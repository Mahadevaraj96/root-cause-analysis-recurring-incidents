# Root Cause Analysis of Recurring IT Incidents

## Objective
To identify and analyze recurring IT incidents using data analytics techniques and provide actionable insights to reduce their recurrence and improve incident management.

## Tools Used
- **SQL**: For querying incident logs and identifying frequent issues.
- **R**: For time series and clustering analysis of incident patterns.
- **Tableau**: For visualizing ticket volumes, affected systems, and resolution trends.

## Methodology
1. **Data Extraction (SQL):**
   - Queried incident management database to extract logs.
   - Identified recurring issues and affected systems.

2. **Data Analysis (R):**
   - Time series analysis to observe patterns over time.
   - K-means clustering to group similar incidents.

3. **Visualization (Tableau):**
   - Created dashboards to highlight:
     - Volume of incidents over time.
     - Top recurring issues.
     - System components most affected.
     - Resolution time trends.
